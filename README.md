# Cosmology Compilation Group

The Cosmology Compilation Group (CCG) initiative is born out of the CosmoVerse White Paper (https://cosmoversetensions.eu/for-scientists/collaborative-projects/white-paper/), where several cosmological models are identified as promising. The aim of the CCG is to compare and contrast these and other active cosmological models in a statistically robust manner, using recent survey public data releases. The initiative involves an Advisory Committee of leading researchers in the field and project coordinators. The goal of the CCG initiative is to include promising cosmological models and statistically contrast their performance in light of the question of cosmological tensions in recent surveys.
